Working on developing the Unified API system for DIC


## Problem Statement
**Project 8 :**  _A backend framework that wraps existing project features into reusable, documented APIs to simplify integration and deployment._  

Design Innovation Center (DIC) has developed(and continues to do so) numerous high-value, innovative student and research projects, yet these solutions remain significantly underutilized due to accessibility barriers and lack of standardized interfaces. Current projects exist as isolated systems without unified (or any known, used) access methods, limiting their potential for broader academic and industry adoption.


## Quick Start Guide for Running the Project

***will be modified as the project progresses**

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- **Node.js** (16.x or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmotionAI/EmotionAI.git
cd EmotionAI
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Node.js Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Backend Setup
Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
# or use nodemon for development
nodemon server.js
```
The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### 4. Frontend Setup
Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd UNIAPI
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5174`

### 5. Verify Installation
- Backend: Visit `http://localhost:5000` to ensure the API is running
- Frontend: Visit `http://localhost:5174` to access the web interface

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter port conflicts, check if the ports 5000 and 5174 are already in use
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed before running the servers
- Check the console output for any error messages
