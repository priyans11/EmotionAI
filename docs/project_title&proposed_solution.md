### Project 2  
**Acoustic Source and Event Detection App**  
Create a lightweight, privacy-preserving mobile/web app to detect and classify acoustic events (e.g., alarms, sirens) using on-device inference. Inspired by the DCASE challenge, it focuses on real-time response and accessibility.

**Deliverables:** Working app prototype, AI model, feedback interface, optional dashboard

---

### Project 3  
**CCTV and Gait Analyzer**  
Build a smart surveillance system that detects safety gear violations using object detection and analyzes abnormal behavior using gait patterns. Supports optional Q&A interface for surveillance logs.

**Deliverables:** Real-time gear detection, gait analysis prototype, web dashboard, integration guide

---

### Project 4  
**Indoor Location Sensing using BLE**  
Design a BLE-based indoor positioning system that assists navigation for users in large facilities by interpreting beacon signals, with potential accessibility use cases.

**Deliverables:** Mobile app, signal-based mapping, admin panel, voice/haptic feedback

---

### Project 5  
**Thermal Imaging for Bacterial Growth Detection**  
Use thermal imaging and computer vision to non-invasively monitor bacterial growth for diagnostics in healthcare or lab settings. Detects subtle thermal changes linked to microbial activity.

**Deliverables:** Detection prototype, visualization dashboard, hardware/software documentation

---

### Project 6  
**Night-Time Traffic Monitoring System**  
Develop a vision system that performs vehicle classification, counting, and number plate detection in low-light/nighttime conditions using enhanced video analysis.

**Deliverables:** Detection pipeline, vehicle classifier, UI for visualization

---

### Project 7  
**On-Device Speech-to-Text Models**  
Explore and deploy low-latency, on-device STT models for offline transcription use cases like lecture recording or voice notes with no internet dependency.

**Deliverables:** Model comparison report, demo app, use case-based recommendations

---

### Project 8  
**Unified API Creation for DIC Projects**  
Expose functionalities from DIC projects through well-documented REST APIs to improve accessibility, integration, and standardization across use cases.

**Deliverables:** REST APIs, API docs (Swagger/Postman), deployment guide

---

### Project 9  
**Multi-modal Attendance System**  
Develop a secure attendance system combining face recognition, voice, Bluetooth, and geolocation to minimize proxies and enhance reliability, with optional red-teaming for security testing.

**Deliverables:** Integrated attendance system, threat model insights, final prototype

---

### Project 10  
**Revamp of PUIC & DIC Websites**  
Redesign and optimize the official PUIC and DIC websites for better performance, aesthetics, and mobile responsiveness, following modern UI/UX practices.

**Deliverables:** Redesigned UI, responsive site, SEO optimization, deployment

---

### Project 11  
**Design Track**  
Focus on UI/UX, graphic design, and prototyping by creating interfaces and visual assets for real or hypothetical use cases. No coding required.

**Deliverables:** Design briefs, wireframes, prototypes, social media graphics
