# Final Submission â€“ AISoC 2025

The final submission will take place **offline**, where each team will present their project in front of the judges.

## What You Need to Do:

- Prepare a **short presentation** explaining your project:
  - What your project does
  - How you built it (tech stack, approach)
  - Challenges you faced
  - Demo of the working project

- Make sure your **GitHub repo** is:
  - Well-organized with clean code
  - Includes a proper `README.md`
  - Has all dependencies listed (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`, etc.)
  - Includes any slides or extra material in a `/presentation` folder

## Note:

- All team members must be present for the presentation.
- Late or incomplete submissions may not be evaluated.

Good luck and build something awesome! ðŸš€
